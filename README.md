# Meanfield

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/flinz/meanfield-suite.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/flinz/meanfield-suite)

Unified modelling framework for validating mean field theory against simulations in spiking networks.

Working in progress. More to come soon.

In the meanwhile, have a look on the [slides](lab/slides.ipynb).
